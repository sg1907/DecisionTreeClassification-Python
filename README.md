A sample ML problem: Naming shapes Ellipse or Circle

A number of ellipticals were formed in which the A / b ratios varied between .90 and 1.10 (21 ellipses).
I gathered data by interviewing 11 people whether or not there was a flat.
If more than 5 people rate as an ellipse circle, this is a circle. Otherwise an ellipse.
Export the result to a txt file.
I applied Linear Regression to this data set.
I draw the results on a graph.

I used the numpy library for graphics. The pygame library is used to draw the ellipses.
